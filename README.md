# Mailing-app
This repository contains my Java Mailing App practice work. I’ve uploaded the code I built while learning how to send emails using Java, including SMTP configuration, message formatting, and basic mail-sending functionality. I’m maintaining this here to track my progress and revisit the concepts whenever needed.
